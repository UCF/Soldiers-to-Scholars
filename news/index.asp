					<h3>Information Security</h3>
<p>Information Security (IS) deals with protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, disclosure of sensitive information, and the disruption of destruction of information. Information Security is an evolving and dynamic field of information technology. As threats to information systems change, the method of protection needs to change to stay ahead of the threats. University of Central Florida recently established two information security policies that addresses the protection of information and information systems. Policy 4-008, Data Classification and Protection, characterizes the types of information UCF deals with on a day-to-day basis and how that information needs to be protected while in storage or in transit from system to system. Information (student, faculty and staff) is one of the most critical assets of the university and this policy addresses its identification and protection. Policy 4-007, Security of Mobile Computing, Data Storage, and Communication.</p>
<p>Devices, addresses the protection of, or the constraints on, portable computing devices. An example would be, the storage of "restricted data," as defined in policy 4-008, on portable computing device must be approved in writing by the employee's dean, director or VP and be based on a legitimate business need. Please review the policies on the University Policies & Procedures website: <a href="http://policies.ucf.edu">http://policies.ucf.edu</a></p>
