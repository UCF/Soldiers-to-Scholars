<h3>Vice President and Chief of Staff</h3>
<p>Identities and concerns discussed with the Ombuds Office will not be shared with anyone else without permission, except to the extent required by law, including without limitation, Chapter 119, Florida Statutes.</p>

<div class="wrap"><img src="../images/global/independencelg.jpg" /><h3>Independence</h3>The Ombuds Office is independent in structure, function and appearance to the highest degree possible within the organization. The Ombuds Officer is not part of line management, does not make management decisions, cannot make anyone take a particular course of action, nor does it take on roles that might compromise independence. The Ombuds Officer has access to all information and all individuals in the university community, as permitted by law. 
<br><br>
The Ombuds Office is part of the President's Division and reports directly to the Chief of Staff and Vice President, Dr. John Schell for budgetary and administrative purposes and functions outside the primary university structure. For example, if you come to the Ombuds Office expecting to get a management decision on a specific issue, that will not happen. The Ombuds Officer cannot compel anyone to take a particular course of action, nor is she under any pressure to act in a certain way because she is part of the President's Division. To further keep from compromising the independence of the office, she does not take on other roles that might compromise, or appear to compromise it.</div>

    <div class="wrap"><img src="../images/global/confidentialitylg.jpg" /><h3>Confidentiality</h3>Probably the most important thing about the Ombuds Office is the fact that it is a SAFE place for you to visit. We do not keep records, although I may jot down a few cryptic notes while we're discussing your concern to help me put my thoughts in order and start organizing them in such a way that I can be helpful to you. These personal notes are kept while we're dealing with the situation and only for a short time thereafter. Once your concern is addressed, they get shredded periodically. Should others need to be involved, or should I need to gather more information regarding the situation, I can assure you that I will always discuss in detail what I plan to do and will not proceed without your permission.  
<br><br>
Sometimes an upset individual will call our office and say that they have a complaint and want to make a record of it.  Because of the confidential nature of the Ombuds Office and the fact that we do not keep records, the Ombuds Officer cannot serve as an "Office of Record," or an "Office of Notice." We will, however, direct you to an appropriate office for that purpose.
<br><br>
The only way your confidentiality would be broken is if there is imminent threat of serious harm. For example, if the Ombuds Officer feels that your life or the life of others is at risk.
