							    	<p>An ombuds officer is an appointed, impartial, and independent party who helps members of the UCF community resolve matters by offering informal and confidential exploration of options.<br>
<br>
The word OMBUDSMAN (om – buds – man) comes from Scandinavia during the 19th century, where the term applied to a public official appointed to investigate citizens’ complaints against government agencies.  The purpose of the Ombuds Office is to assure that every voice in the organization can be heard and that every problem can receive an impartial review.
